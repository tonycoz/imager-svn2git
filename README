Not really intended for public consumption, these scripts are in
development to extract the Imager portions of my svn repo, clean up
the paths, and convert it to git.


The initial commit here is mostly ok, but some older branches
originally in the CVS repo are being converted under an Imager/ base
path, which need to be fixed.
